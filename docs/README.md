The Culqi PHP library provides convenient access to the Culqi API from
applications written in the PHP language. This library is only compatible with the version 2 of the Culqi API.

## Requirements

PHP 5.3 and later.

## Composer

You can install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```sh
composer require culqi/culqi-php
```

To use the library, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Manual Installation

If you do not wish to use Composer, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/culqi/culqi-php/releases). Then, to use the library, include the `culqi.php` file.

```php
require_once('/path/to/culqi-php/lib/culqi.php');
```
